| **Scrape Latency**    | Time taken to scrape metrics endpoints                                      | OTEL Collector logs/metrics, Prometheus         |
| **Ingestion Latency** | Time from metric emission to ingestion by the collector                     | Timestamps in metrics, logs                     |

| **Dropped Metrics**   | Number of metrics dropped due to overload or errors                         | OTEL Collector self-metrics, logs               |
| **Error Rate**        | Number of errors encountered during collection or export                    | OTEL Collector self-metrics, logs               |

## 3. Measurement Methodology

1. **Baseline Measurement**
   - Start OTEL Collector with no load.
   - Record baseline CPU and memory usage.

2. **Incremental Load Testing**
   - Gradually increase the number of scraped endpoints and push clients.
   - For each step, record:
     - CPU and memory usage
     - Scrape and ingestion latency
     - Throughput
     - Any dropped metrics or errors

3. **Peak Load Testing**
   - Simulate maximum expected load (e.g., N endpoints, M push clients).
   - Monitor for sustained performance, resource saturation, or failures.

4. **Simultaneous Collection**
   - Ensure both push and pull sources are active.
   - Observe for resource contention or metric loss.

## 4. Tools Used

- **System Monitoring:** `top`, `htop`, `docker stats`, or equivalent
- **OTEL Collector Self-Metrics:** Exposed at `/metrics` endpoint (Prometheus format)
- **Prometheus:** For scraping and visualizing OTEL Collector metrics
- **Grafana:** (Optional) For dashboarding and visualization
- **Custom Scripts:** For generating push metrics and simulating load

## 7. Observations

- _Note any performance bottlenecks, resource saturation, or unexpected behavior._
- _Highlight the collectorâ€™s ability to handle simultaneous push and pull loads._
- _Record any configuration changes that improved performance._

## 8. Recommendations

- _Summarize optimal configuration and resource requirements for your use case._
- _Suggest monitoring thresholds and scaling strategies._

OpenTelemetry Collector is a highly flexible and powerful tool for observability, capable of collecting metrics using both push and pull modes simultaneously within a single instance. By supporting multiple receivers in the same pipeline, the collector enables organizations to integrate modern, cloud-native applications that push metrics (such as via OTLP), as well as legacy or third-party systems that expose metrics endpoints for scraping (such as via Prometheus). This dual capability simplifies observability architectures, reduces operational complexity, and allows for a unified approach to monitoring diverse environments
